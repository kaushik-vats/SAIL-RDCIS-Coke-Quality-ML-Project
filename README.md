SAIL RDCIS – Coke Quality Prediction Using ML & Data Analytics
This repository contains my summer internship project completed at the Research & Development Centre for Iron & Steel (RDCIS), Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Ranchi.

Project Title
Data-Driven Coke Quality Prediction using Regression Modelling and Machine Learning Techniques

Project Objective
To analyze the impact of coal blend properties such as moisture, ash, and volatile matter on coke quality parameters (M40, M10, CRI, CSR) using regression-based machine learning models.

Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Excel
- Google Colab
- Regression Modelling (Simple & Multivariate)

Key Concepts Applied
- Linear & Multivariate Regression
- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R²)
- Regression assumptions (Linearity, Normality, Homoscedasticity)
- Data visualization & trend analysis

Key Outcomes
- Developed predictive models for coke quality parameters
- Identified relationships between coal properties and coke performance
- Achieved high prediction accuracy with MAPE < 2%
- Gained hands-on experience with real industrial datasets
